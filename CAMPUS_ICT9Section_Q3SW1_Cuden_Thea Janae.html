     <p>This drama is based on a traditional Joseon legend about a fisherman who captures and kidnaps a mermaid. It chronicles the love tale of Kim Dam Ryung and Se Hwa, a mermaid he named Se Hwa. Heo Joon Jae is now a smooth-talking conman with magician-like talents. He poses as a prosecutor and defrauds a wealthy suspect's mother before fleeing to Spain and staying at an oceanfront resort. Shim Chung is a mermaid who is trapped in a tidal wave and washes ashore near the resort, where she meets Joon Jae.</p>
